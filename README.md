Hyperlinks is the work I did in my lesson about hyperlinks. This was the first time I've ever coded with hyperlinks. It includes links to images, links to download images, and links to additional websites, like Google. These are only a few that you can expect.

Hyperlinks demonstrates my competency in the skills I learned in the lesson. I like to look at it as allowing me to showcase the work that I am doing to learn code. It provides any visitor a way to understand my workflow, as well. Creating all the original documents, such as the README and .gitignore, is in important part of practicing industry standard workflows.

While this started out as a one-time project, it has evolved into an ongoing exhibition with portions getting added, regularly. They will build upon these skills, while establishing new ones. Please be on the lookout on Github, under the username domguerr.
